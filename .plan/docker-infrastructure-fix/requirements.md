## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **NFR-001**: Optimize container startup time (< 2 minutes for full stack)
- **NFR-002**: Implement proper resource limits and reservations
- **NFR-003**: Configure caching strategies for better performance

### 2. Security
- **NFR-004**: All containers run as non-root users
- **NFR-005**: Implement proper network segmentation
- **NFR-006**: Secure secret management
- **NFR-007**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

### 3. Reliability
- **NFR-008**: Implement proper health checks and monitoring
- **NFR-009**: Configure automatic restart policies
- **NFR-010**: Set up proper logging and error handling

### 4. Maintainability
- **NFR-011**: Clear documentation and comments
- **NFR-012**: Modular configuration structure
- **NFR-013**: Easy environment switching

## Tech Stack Decisions

### Docker & Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: v2.24+ (latest stable)
- **Docker Engine**: v24+ (latest stable)
- **Base Images**: Alpine Linux 3.18+ for all services
- **Multi-stage builds**: For optimized production images

### Database & Cache
- **PostgreSQL**: 15-alpine (LTS version)
- **Redis**: 7-alpine (latest stable)
- **Kafka**: Confluent Platform 7.4.0 (latest stable)

### Application Stack
- **NestJS**: Node.js 18-alpine
- **Next.js**: Node.js 18-alpine
- **React Native**: Node.js 18-alpine with Expo CLI

### Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer
- **Nginx**: 1.25-alpine (latest stable)

## Integration Points

### 1. Database Integration
- PostgreSQL with proper initialization scripts
- Redis for caching and session management
- Kafka for event streaming

### 2. Application Integration
- NestJS API with proper health checks
- Next.js client with static optimization
- React Native mobile app with development tools

### 3. Infrastructure Integration
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- Proper networking and service discovery
- Volume management and data persistence

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Must support both development and production environments
- Must be compatible with existing project structure
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations

### Assumptions
- Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed
- Sufficient system resources available (8GB RAM minimum)
- Network connectivity for pulling base images
- Proper file system permissions for volume mounting

## Success Criteria

### 1. Functional Success
- All services start successfully with `docker-compose up`
- All health checks pass within 2 minutes
- Services can communicate with each other
- Data persists across container restarts
- Environment switching works correctly

### 2. Performance Success
- Full stack startup time < 2 minutes
- Memory usage < 4GB for development
- CPU usage < 50% during normal operation
- Network latency < 100ms between services

### 3. Security Success
- All containers run as non-root users
- No hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- Proper network isolation implemented
- Security scanning passes without critical issues

### 4. Maintainability Success
- Clear documentation for all configurations
- Easy environment switching
- Modular and maintainable structure
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
