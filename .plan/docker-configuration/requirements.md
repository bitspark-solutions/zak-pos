- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and deployment guides
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent dev/staging/production environments

## User Stories

### US-001: Developer Environment Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want** to start the entire POS system with a single command  
**So that** I can quickly set up my development environment  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up` to start all services
- [ ] All services are accessible on their designated ports
- [ ] Database is automatically initialized with schema
- [ ] Hot reload works for both frontend and backend

### US-002: Production Deployment
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** to deploy the POS system to production using Docker  
**So that** I can ensure consistent and reliable deployments  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Production-optimized Docker images
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration
- [ ] Health monitoring and logging
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability

### US-003: Service Monitoring
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to monitor the health of all containerized services  
**So that** I can ensure system reliability and performance  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Container restart policies
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Centralized logging

## Tech Stack Decisions

### Container Runtime
- **Docker Engine**: 24.0+ (latest stable)
- **Docker Compose**: 2.20+ for orchestration

### Base Images
- **Node.js**: `node:22-alpine` for lightweight containers <mcreference link="https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/running-nextjs-with-docker" index="5">5</mcreference>
- **PostgreSQL**: `postgres:16-alpine` for database
- **Redis**: `redis:7-alpine` for caching
- **Kafka**: `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0` for messaging

### Development Tools
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized production images <mcreference link="https://dev.to/codeparrot/nextjs-deployment-with-docker-complete-guide-for-2025-3oe8" index="3">3</mcreference>
- **Docker BuildKit** for enhanced build performance
- **Health checks** for service monitoring

## Integration Points

### API Communication
- **Backend-Frontend**: REST API over HTTP
- **Mobile-Backend**: REST API with WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection pooling
- **Cache**: Redis for session and data caching
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event-driven architecture

### External Services
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe/PayPal integration
- **Email Services**: SMTP configuration
- **File Storage**: Local volumes with S3 compatibility

## Compliance Requirements

### PCI-DSS Compliance
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
